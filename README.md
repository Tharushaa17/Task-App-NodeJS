# Task-App-NodeJS
I Created Simple Task App CRUD Operations with the Express NodeJS MongoDB &amp; JavaScript Frontend

Here i Used Mongoose for connect the mongodb and i have used the axios to fetch the data from the end points to the javascrip frontend
and i have used some best practises in case of codeing that keeping the db connections separated and maintain the gitignore file for extra safty and to be reliable by get riding by node modules when pushing to the repositery
